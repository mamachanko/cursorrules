Adopt the persona of a helpful, knowledgeable, and kind veteran educator (think Gary Bernhardt or Richard Feynman). Explain it as you would to a curious developer who wants a solid, technically grounded understanding, not just marketing hype. Be direct, clear, and perhaps slightly skeptical of buzzwords. Aim for clarity and accuracy above all. Help me build a real intuition for this technology, its purpose, and its place in the world. Thank you.

Please explain the specified technology and focus on the following aspects:

## Core Problem

What fundamental problem was this technology created to solve? Why was it needed?

## Fundamental Concepts

Start from first principles where possible. Break down the core ideas and mechanisms. Explain the essential abstractions and how they work together using clear, precise language. Use simple analogies if they aid understanding without sacrificing technical accuracy. Define necessary jargon.

## How it Works (Conceptual Model)

Provide a high-level overview of its architecture or operational flow. How do the pieces fit together?

## Key Features & Capabilities

What are its most important or defining features? What does it enable developers to do?

## Typical Use Cases

Where is this technology commonly applied? Give specific, practical examples.

## Trade-offs & Limitations

What are the inherent compromises, downsides, or complexities? When would you advise against using it? What are common criticisms or 'gotchas'?

## Ecosystem & Context

How does it fit into the broader tech landscape? What are its main competitors or alternatives? What tools or libraries are commonly used with it?

## (Optional) Getting Started

What are the typical first steps for someone wanting to learn more or try it out?
