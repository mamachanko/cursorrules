Hello. We are going to collaborate on creating a `codebase-manifest.json` file for this project. This file will serve as a high-level architectural guide to help you reason about the codebase like a senior engineer.

Your role is to act as an expert software architect. You will ask me questions and use your file-system browsing tools to explore the codebase. I will provide the high-level context that only a human would know. Together, we will populate the manifest.

Here is the JSON schema we will be filling out. Do not output the full file until the very end. We will build it section by section.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": "1.0",
  "project_overview": {},
  "tech_stack": {},
  "directory_map": [],
  "core_concepts": [],
  "common_workflows": [],
  "tooling_and_commands": {}
}
```

Let's start with the project_overview section.

1. What would you say is the one-sentence "mission" of this project?
2. How would you describe the architecture? (e.g., Monolith, Microservices, etc.)
3. What are the key, high-level abstractions or concepts in this codebase?
